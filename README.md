A simple bash script for creating a java project to the specs of 
our class, COMP305 Introduction to Java.
Usage: from the command line, run

$ java_init_project ProjectName

the script will run in the current directory and create a directory
name ProjectName (or named Application1 if no Project Name is provided.
It will also create several subdirectories, an App.java file under src,
and a Makefile.
